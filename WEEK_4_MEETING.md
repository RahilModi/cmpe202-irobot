## Week 4

### What did the team do the past week?
* Aditya: Design elements which are hit by ball. Implement logic for the same.

* Afreen: Added bricks design module which has been assigned.

* Neil: Added slider in game world and when ball hits slider it is returned. Slider movement with keyboard left, right button.

* Purvesh: Worked on adding the Mute/Un-mute functionality with appropriate images with turn on/off background sound of the game. Explored examples to figure out APIs for changing the ball velocity dynamically.

* Rahil: Implemented collision detection between object(bricks) and ball. When this happens object will be disappeared and player's score will be incremented accordingly. 

### What is the team going to do next week?
* Aditya: Add new feature like powerup, get extra point, get speed etc.
