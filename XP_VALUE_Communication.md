Page includes information about how team is following Extreme Programming core value **'Communication'** over every week.

### Define Communication under consideration of XP? 

Extreme programming define Communication as vital process to be followed through out project development. Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

### Week 1

## MOM: Meeting 1

* Every team member has discussed about technical stack to meet project backlogs.
* Individuals has decided to do research on different technical stack to define suitability.

### Week 2

## MOM: Meeting 2

* We discussed about difficulties faced during past week while researching about different game engine.
* We discussed about demo created by Purvesh. He has explained about the challenges faced and knowledge required to to develop basic demo in progress of game development.

### Week 3

## MOM: Meeting 3
