## Project Work ##

1) Research about libGDX and its implementation for web based game
2) LWJGl : https://www.lwjgl.org/ : java game library but only desktop java games will be feasible. So leaving it
3) openGL and webGL understanding that how java game library uses it internally
4) Created sample projects for libGDX
5) Used gradle and how to use it with the GWT - Google Web Toolkit to implement it for web games
6) Installed various libraries and searched on github for game engine specifically java based
7) Faced some challenges about integration of various type of projects and web based game engines in java.


### PhaserJS
* Understood some examples given on the website.
* Implemented some of them as a part of prototype.
* Using Apache server.
* Everytime all files should be put in /var/www/html/hellophaser directory
* Access game from localhost:hellophaser
* This shows sample demo as per code in index.html file in above directory.

* Javascript is used so it will be good option for web UI game and phaserJS documentation is also available to figure out many scenarios.
