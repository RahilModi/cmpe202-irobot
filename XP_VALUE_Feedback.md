This Wiki page contains information about how the team implemented XP core principle **Feedback** during each week.

### What is Feedback?
Feedback is a way of determining the current state of the system, product, or project. Feedback can come from various sources like the code itself based on the test results, from the client when acceptance tests are provided, and from the team when a new user story is created. In short, it is a commitment to deliver working software every iteration.

## Week-1
* As this was the first week, we did not have any code to test or any user functional requirements so that we can get feedback via these ways.
* For the first week, we have decided to start work on the prototype for a few game ideas using different frameworks so that in the upcoming weeks we can demonstrate our work and get the feedback within the team on one another's progress and technology selection.
* This is the first step towards getting the feedback.

## Week-2
* This week we practiced the Feedback principle by giving the feedback on each other's work in the team. As we didn't have any functional requirements yet, we cannot get the feedback from the client's perspective.
* Every team member came up with some code and opinion about the technology they were working on. Based on individual's progress on the prototype, everyone provided their input on how everyone should explore the particular technology they were working and what to develop so that we can decide on the game engine.
