This Wiki page contains information about how the team implemented XP core principle **Feedback** during each week.

### What is Feedback?
Feedback is a way of determining the current state of the system, product, or project. Feedback can come from various sources like the code itself based on the test results, from the client when acceptance tests are provided, and from the team when a new user story is created. In short, it is a commitment to deliver working software every iteration.

## Week-1
* As this was the first week, we did not have any code to test or any user functional requirements so that we can get feedback via these ways.
* For the first week, we have decided to start work on the prototype for a few game ideas using different frameworks so that in the upcoming weeks we can demonstrate our work and get the feedback within the team on one another's progress and technology selection.
* This is the first step towards getting the feedback.

## Week-2
* This week we practiced the Feedback principle by giving the feedback on each other's work in the team. As we didn't have any functional requirements yet, we cannot get the feedback from the client's perspective.
* Every team member came up with some code and opinion about the technology they were working on. Based on individual's progress on the prototype, everyone provided their input on how everyone should explore the particular technology they were working and what to develop so that we can decide on the game engine.

## Week-3
* This week we decided the technology stack for the web based game by the feedback provided by team members on their technologies.
* Each team member demonstrated their efforts by creating the prototype and after two weeks, each member provided their feedback on the simplicity, complexity, documentation and support for each technology. Also, other team members provided their input on the prototype.
* Based on the discussion, we decided to use Phaser.io JavaScript game engine and discarded the prototypes created in Babylon.js and Greenfoot.

## Week-4
* This week, each team member gave their feedback on the work everyone has done for the project. I got the feedback from the team members about the sound files I selected for the game. They were approved by the team members.
* Also, each team member gave feedback on the tasks done by everyone including handling paddle bar with the arrow keys on keyboard and hiding the elements when the collision occurs.
* Also, we tested the functionalities implemented and tweaked based on the feedback got from the manual testing.

## Week-5
* This week, every team member gave their feedback on the patterns generated for the objects which ball can hit. Based on the feedback, we decided to use the some of the already implemented patterns and discard couple of patterns.
* Also, based on the feedback, we decided to add couple of more patterns of objects in the game which will be changed after completion of each stage.
* We discussed about the various power ups in the game and finalized some power up features for the same.

## Week-6
* Since we have a working game with features, we tested some of the features of the game and was able to find some issues in the features. This way we got the feedback from the code this week.
* Also, we have all the power ups finalized and implemented in the game, we discussed about those features and everyone gave their feedback on the power ups. We also decided to change the behavior of a couple of power ups feature based on the feedback received.
* Every team member came up the with possible design patterns which can be implemented. All gave their feedback on the ideas of the design pattern and finalized Chain of Responsibility, Factory Method and Observer design patterns and decided to implement those patterns first.
