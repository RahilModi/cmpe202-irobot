## Week 5

### What did the team do the past week?

Aditya: Implement five patterns for stage one with many different objects and styles which will render dynamically. 

Afreen: Implement breakout patterns for different stages.

Neil: Integrated slider functionality with all other functionalities of a game. Implemented slider size change dynamically as oject hits it and its type.

Purvesh: Worked on implementing power up features in the game where speed of the ball is increased for a certain amount of time and multiple balls will be simultaneously in play until a player looses all the live balls.

Rahil: Integrated collision detection component of the game, added limit of powerups per level and new level on completion.

### What is the team going to do next week?

Aditya:  Implement five patterns for stage two with many different objects and styles which will render dynamically. Add Design pattern concepts.

Afreen: Implementing breakout pattern for stage one.

Neil: Implement a desugn pattern related to a specific functionality and combine these design patterns.

Purvesh: Will work on adding more features related to the collision of the ball and pattern and will start implementing design patterns.

Rahil: Design pattern related to functionality will be implemented.

### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?

Aditya: How we are going to use Design Pattern concepts for our project.

Afreen: So far no blockers.

Neil: No blockers.

Purvesh: Facing a bug related to the multiple balls in the game where balls do not behave as expected in an unknown scenario.

Rahil: Currently no obstacles.
