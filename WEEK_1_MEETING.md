## Week 1

### What did the team do the past week?
* Aditya: I have researched on available jaavscript frameworks like phaser.js Babylon.js pixi.js.
I have tried to make prototype for cubeslam game . I have found out that phaser.js is best for our requirements.

* Afreen: Researched on game engines like Greenfoot and JMonkey, went through documentation of each engine. Explored on the greenfoot with different prebuilt game scenarios. Started working on building prototype using greenfoot.

* Neil: 
Research about Technologies and libraries available to use in the project like libGDX, openGL, webGL, HTML5, greenfoot, LWJGL etc.   
Research about various web-based games which fit in the project time frame and requirement.  
Understood libGDX that how it can be used in the project and itâ€™s pros and cons.  
Creating sample project and prototype for sample game development for the initial face.  
For example, I have chosen paper ball throwing the trash game and creating a prototype of it and how openGL, HTML5 are fit in that.  

* Purvesh: I explored JavaScript game engines MelonJS and PhaserJS. Went through the documentation and examples of both the game engines. Started working on creating the prototype of a game using Phaser js.

* Rahil: Research few web technologies are being used in game development such as WebGL, webRTC, WebSocket. Also, study various Javascript 2D and 3D graphics rendering libraries/frameworks for the project. Went through some pros and cons of 3D rendering libraries such as Three.js, Babylon.js and playcanvas. Finally selected Babylon.js for the prototype development of the pong game. Also created 3D sample scene using babylon.js.

### What is the team going to do next week?
* Aditya: I will develop samples demo for code slam game using phaser.js framework. 

* Afreen: I will be continue working on the greenfoot to develope prototype of 'Bubble shooter'. Depending on this week results will be deciding which stack to be used for final term project.

* Neil: 
JavaScript game engines like Phaser.js, melonjs, kiwijs, etc. creating sample project. 
How javascript game engines fit in the sample game. I will be figuring out the best option. 

* Purvesh: I will continue work on the prototype of the game so that we can have a working model at the end of the week. Based on the results, We can decide whether we can select the PhaserJS for the project.

* Rahil: I will continue my work on the understanding about babylon.js using some tutorials available on the net and will implement those learning in the prototype development. So that we can finalize Babylon.js for the project.

### What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
* Aditya: My current backlog is learning new framework as fast as i can . so we can start development. 

* Afreen: No blockers are there. Simultaneously exploring about libraries available on greenfoot.

* Neil:
Currently, search about the various game engines, libraries and integration are going on so no issues are impeding me in this project.  

* Purvesh: At the moment, no blockers/challenges are there.

* Rahil: As I have been doing research and feasibility study for our model. So, there is no issue which is hindering my progress.
