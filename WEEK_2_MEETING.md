## Week 2

### What did the team do the past week?
* Purvesh

* Neil: Created a prototype of a sample game in Phasor JS to understand how it works and what features it offers. Figured out that Javascript game engines are better than Java web-based game engines.

* Aditya -> I have created a basic object in Babylon.js. I have tried to learn Babylon.js, But Babylon is a bit complex than phaser.js.

* Afreen: I have created basic functionality in greenfoot. Learned about greenfoot web deployment.  

* Rahil: I learned basics of babylon.js and created the very simple model of the pong game using babylon.js and came to know that it will be very difficult and complex to develop a game using Babylon.js.




### What is the team going to do next week?
* Purvesh

* Neil: Almost finalized Javascript game engine and now game features and overall design will be decided. Features and design pattern will be divided into the team and understand how to implement it.

* Aditya: Learning phaser.js and started development work on Game which will be decided by the team.

* Afreen: Learning greenfoot API, will be finalizing this stack for final term project.

* Rahil: As of this week work, I learned that babylon.js is a bit complex to develop a game than phaser.js and having the main focus of the project to implement design patterns. So will start learning **Phaser.js** and working on the game development which will be decided by the team.
